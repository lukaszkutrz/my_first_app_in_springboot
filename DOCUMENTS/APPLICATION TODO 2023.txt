 PLANS FOR YEAR 2023
######################

MOST IMPORTANT:
###################

1) Slightly rework endpoints/controllers, something like this (new/edit are wrong):

/dogs      GET  -> list of dogs
/dogs/new  GET  -> form add new dog
/dogs      POST -> adding new dog
/dogs/:id  GET  -> info about 1 dog
/dogs/:id/edit GET  -> form edit dog
/dogs/:id      PUT  -> update dog

2) Additional field "Part of series" for books. For example Harry Potter
series has 7 book titles, and Lord Of The Rings series has 3:
Fellowship of the ring, The Two Towers, Return of the King,
Our search should have option searching by series name.

3) Better Server Side Verification - Very important - fields like ISBN or telephone number should be verfied against regex on Server side,

4) Moving Business Logic from Controllers to Model / Service classes
 
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) Add return book button. When we go into book details (books/{id}) and the book is rented, the "return book" button should be visible,

2) Add button. In tab "Rented Books" each book should have option "View Info"

3) Additional field "telephone number" for user, it should be validated
in JQUERY format (\d\d\d\-\d\d\d-\d\d\d)

4) Refactoring of returning of the book - currently we use user id AND
book id - book id alone should be enough,

5) Limit of rented books - max 3 books for user, and if user already has
3, cannot book another one

6) Currently - if we want to add the same book, we have to do this manually copying all of the values. We should have a button + number input - clicking button adds identical books with the same data. Amount
of added copies i from inside mentioned input.

-------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL:

1) Verify APP using sonar,
